Sometimes choosing an address based on your current location can be inaccurate, especially in high-density neighborhoods, areas with challenging geography or sporadic GPS signal. Other times drivers can find themselves at the wrong location if the address has ambiguous signage, restricted parking, or unsafe conditions for exchanging vehicles. We do our best to meet you at the exact location that you choose. If you believe the driver was in error and met you in the wrong location, please let us know here.";

"helpMyDriverWasLateDetail" = "Occasionally due to circumstances outside of our control, our pickup and delivery services can get a little behind schedule.

In that case we try to connect the driver to the customer via phone. If the driver is still unable to find the customer, our policy is to bring the customer’s car back to the dealership, and reschedule delivery for a later time.

Either the driver is temporarily passing through an area with no mobile connectivity, or it is an unsafe moment for the driver to respond to a message or receive a call. In that case, the driver will pull-over once it is safe and try to contact the customer.\n\nIf you’re having trouble reaching your driver, you can wait a minute or two, and try contacting the driver again.
