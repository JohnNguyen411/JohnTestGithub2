	[MyVehicleWasDamagedDetail]

In order to keep complete records of vehicles throughout service, our drivers photograph both customer and loaner vehicles at multiple points through pickup and delivery. If your vehicle was damaged as part of pickup or delivery, please let us know here.
	[ILostAnItemDetail]
		en = If a driver finds an item left behind in a loaner, we make every attempt to contact customers, and return the item. Sometimes, the item might not be found immediately though. If you believe you lost something in your vehicle or your loaner, please get in touch with the dealership as soon as you notice its missing.\n\nGenerally lost items are kept for 45 days. If they go unclaimed, the items are donated to a charity or disposed of.
	[MyPickupDeliveryLocationWasWrongDetail]
		en = If the driver met you somewhere other than the address you specified, its useful to know why. Sometimes choosing an address based on your current location can be inaccurate, especially in high-density neighborhoods, areas with challenging geography or sporadic GPS signal. Other times drivers can find themselves at the wrong location if the address has ambiguous signage, restricted parking, or unsafe conditions for exchanging vehicles. We do our best to meet you at the exact location that you choose. If you believe the driver was in error and met you in the wrong location, please let us know here.
	[MyDriverWasLateDetail]
		en = Occassionally due to circumstances outside of our control, our pickup and delivery services can get a little behind schedule. We make every attempt to contact our customers to know if we are running late. If a driver didn't show up, usually they tried but failed to find the customer. In that case we try to connect the driver to the customer via phone. If the driver is still unable to find the customer, our policy is to bring the customer's car back to the dealership, and reschedule delivery for a later time. If our driver was unable to find you, or if you believe they never showed up, please let us know here.
	[IMissedMyPickupDeliveryDetail]
		en = `If you missed your pickup/delivery window, don't worry. If it was a pickup, the driver returned to the dealership with the loaner vehicle. If it was a delivery, the driver brought your vehicle back to the dealership. You can call or email the dealership to reschedule. `

	[ICouldntContactMyDriverDetail]
		en = While rare, sometimes customers aren't able to contact their drivers. This is generally due to two reasons. Either the driver is temporarily passing through an area with no mobile connectivity, or it is an unsafe moment for the driver to respond to a message or receive a call. In that case, the driver will pull-over once it is safe and try to contact the customer.\n\nIf you're having trouble reaching your driver, you can wait a minute or two, and try contacting the driver again. If the problem persists, please let us know here.
	[MyDriverWasUnprofessionalDetail]
