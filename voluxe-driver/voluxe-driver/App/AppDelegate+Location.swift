// Implementations of CLLocationManager often wrap it in a singleton
// with callbacks.  There is nothing wrong with that approach, so this
// is an experiment to see if there is an advantage to coupling a bit
// closer with the AppDelegate.  There already is an ownership between
// AppDelegate and AppController, and it feels cleaner to be able to
// react to app foreground/background events directly from the AppDelegate,
// then forward on to the AppController for UI reactions.  This frees
// other services, like the RequestManager, from having to interact
// with the location singleton, and can instead use a local instance of
// CLLocationManager strictly for location changes.
