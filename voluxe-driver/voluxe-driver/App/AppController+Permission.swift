    // managed by the AppController presentation of it, or does not
    // exist.

    // inside of a MainViewController from togglePermissionRequired().
    // If the style of presentation changes there, this will need to
    // be updated as well.

    // a previously not allowed permission, nothing can happen until that UI

    // changes from "not allowed" to "allowed", the associated UI will be dismissed.

    // Note that this presents the permission controller hosted in a MainViewController.
    // This is because the design requires the titled navigation bar which is
    // easily obtained by using a MainViewController.  It is presented modally
    // because pushing the permission onto the current main view controller stack
    // would require dumping the entire stack, but then what would dimissing
    // it go back to?  Presenting modally also the current view controller stack to
    // remain intact until this is dismissed, much easier to implement.
